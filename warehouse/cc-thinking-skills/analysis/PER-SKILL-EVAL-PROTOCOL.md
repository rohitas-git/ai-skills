# Per-Skill Experiment & Eval Protocol (elevate-or-kill)

For **every one of the 39 skills**: the domains where it drives better outcomes, the eval **mode**, the **comparison + elevate-or-kill rule**, and the **dataset** (verified HuggingFace id or "author synthetic"). Built on the isolated, length-controlled harness (`evals/`, `experiments/`).

## Universal decision rule
Run **skill** vs **length-matched placebo** (and vs a **2-sentence trigger**) under isolation (`EVAL_NO_ISOLATE` unset). Pool to ≥~40 decisive comparisons.
- **ELEVATE** — pooled **lower 95% CI > 50%** (significant positive lift over placebo). For routing skills: accuracy clearly beats the no-router baseline.
- **KILL / REWORK** — CI includes or sits below 50% at N≥40.
- **TRIGGER-ONLY** — the 2-sentence trigger matches the full guide (ship the trigger, drop the textbook).
- Per-skill verdicts need ≥~20–40 problems; below that = directional.

## Eval-mode split (determines execution)
- **Correctness** (objective ground truth — cheapest, least gameable): bayesian, probabilistic, fermi-estimation, dual-process, occams-razor, debiasing, kepner-tregoe(PA), theory-of-constraints, scientific-method, five-whys-plus, systems, red-team, first-principles(Fermi half).
- **Routing** (does the right call/skill fire): bounded-rationality, socratic, map-territory, circle-of-competence, margin-of-safety, ooda, cynefin, model-router, model-selection, model-combination.
- **Pairwise** (open decision, blind judge): second-order, inversion, pre-mortem, regret-minimization, opportunity-cost, reversibility, steel-manning, feedback-loops, archetypes, leverage-points, triz, thought-experiment, lindy-effect, via-negativa, jobs-to-be-done, effectuation, first-principles(design half), kepner-tregoe(DA half).

## Notes
- **Strongest published effect sizes** (anchor expectations): pre-mortem (~+30% reasons surfaced), debiasing/opportunity-cost-neglect (replicable lab effects), inversion (InvThink harm-reduction).
- **TRIGGER-ONLY is a genuinely likely outcome** for skills whose active ingredient is a single reframe: pre-mortem, opportunity-cost, reversibility, regret-minimization, ooda, dual-process, theory-of-constraints, cynefin, archetypes.
- **Over-application guard:** occams-razor MUST include trap cases (complex-cause-correct) or it scores well by mis-firing.
- **Meta-routers (model-*) need no HF data** — they're evaluated on our own catalog + labeled prompts; `model-selection` must beat `model-router`-alone or be merged.
- Licenses vary — ClariQ "unknown", ddxplus has an author takedown request, several gated. Verify before redistribution; keep in `evals/datasets/external/` (segregated, non-MIT).
