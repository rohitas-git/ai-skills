# Adversarial Synthesis — cc-thinking-skills

> **⚠️ SUPERSEDED — 2026-06-07 (Elevate-or-Kill M5 outcome)**
> This synthesis was written BEFORE the M5 powered runs and before the canonical scorecard was finalized. Several of its evaluative claims about skill performance and effectiveness are superseded by powered evidence (post-edit provenance: see canonical scorecard). The canonical scorecard at `analysis/ELEVATE-OR-KILL-SCORECARD.md` is the authoritative source for current verdicts. See `analysis/STALE-CLAIM-CLEANUP.md` for the full cleanup notes. **The structural findings, reviewer insights, and recommendations R1–R9 remain useful context; specific performance/ELEVATE/significance claims inline-marked [SUPERSEDED] are historical only.**

The headline deliverable: cross-model consensus, the most valuable unique ideas, genuine disagreements, and a prioritized (recommend-only) improvement list — all cross-referenced against the eval data.

## Method

Three frontier models reviewed the collection through `droid` at their highest reasoning effort:
- **gpt-5.5-pro** (`xhigh`)
- **gemini-3.1-pro-preview** (`high`)
- **deepseek-v4-pro** (`max`)

**Hybrid** scope: each did one holistic review of the whole collection + the eval design (`reviews/holistic/`), plus a deep per-skill pass on the 8 weakest-by-rubric skills + router (`reviews/per-skill/`, 23 of 24 reviews returned). Findings are cross-referenced against the 4-tier eval harness run (`evals/results/run1/scorecard.md`). Raw artifacts are reproducible via `reviews/*.js` and `evals/run-*.js`.

A note on what to trust: at 3 problems/skill the Tier 3 per-skill numbers are **directional**, not definitive (all three reviewers flagged this; the binomial noise on 3 trials is large). The reliable signals are the **cross-skill aggregate**, the **dimension-level patterns**, and the **unanimous qualitative consensus** below.

---

## 1. Consensus findings (ranked)

### C1. The skills are human artifacts ported to agents without adaptation — the #1 finding (3/3 + both judges)
Every reviewer, independently, reached the same conclusion, and the Tier 1 judge corroborated it:
- **GPT-5.5:** "human coaching/workshop artifacts translated too literally, with weak stop conditions, weak non-use guidance, and too much risk of framework theater or prompt bloat."
- **Gemini-3.1:** "highly articulate *consultantware* … forcing frontier LLMs to output 12-point checklists or 5-level causality chains frequently causes them to **hallucinate evidence to fill the template**."
- **DeepSeek-V4:** "designed for human readers and ported to agents without adapting for how LLMs actually fail (they don't have System 1 'gut feelings,' they have sycophancy, recency bias, and context-window blind spots)."

**Eval corroboration:** Tier 1's lowest dimension across all 39 skills is **discrimination (3.38/5)** vs fidelity **4.95/5** — the content is accurate but under-bounded. Tier 1 independently raised **6 "would-mislead-an-agent" flags**, each describing a *human-context* failure: `regret-minimization` → "project to age 80 triggers bizarre roleplay"; `pre-mortem` → "'Gather the team / silent brainstorming' causes the agent to halt and facilitate a human meeting"; `circle-of-competence` → "evaluate its track record → hallucinate a human persona"; `bayesian` → "hallucinate arbitrary exact probabilities"; `socratic` → "endlessly interrogate the user instead of writing code". The per-skill pass returned **"sharpen" on all 8 skills, "would-mislead" on 23/24 reviews — unanimous.**

### C2. Missing "when NOT to use" boundaries are a hazard for an autonomous agent (3/3)
Distinct from C1 and the single highest-leverage *content* fix. A skill with no stop condition invites over-use: running a 12-point audit on a trivial reversible choice, "challenging assumptions" into reinventing auth, interrogating instead of coding. Only ~12/39 skills document anti-patterns today. GPT: "weak stop conditions, weak non-use guidance." This is independently the weakest Tier 1 dimension (discrimination).

### C3. Five overlap clusters should be consolidated (3/3, with strong agreement on three)
Merge proposals, normalized across reviewers:
- **`bayesian` + `probabilistic` → one skill** — unanimous (3/3).
- **`model-selection` → fold into `model-router`** — effectively unanimous (3/3; one also folds `model-combination`).
- **`inversion` + `pre-mortem` (+ `red-team`) → one "surface failure paths" skill** — effectively unanimous (3/3; two add red-team).
- **Root-cause: `five-whys-plus` + `scientific-method` + `kepner-tregoe`** — GPT explicit, DeepSeek noted, Gemini flagged `five-whys` weak.
- **Systems: `systems` + `feedback-loops` + `leverage-points` + `archetypes`** — GPT explicit.

**Eval corroboration:** Tier 2 routing is **99% lenient but only 90% strict/unique**; every one of the 6 discrimination-only misroutes falls inside these clusters (`scientific-method`→`five-whys-plus` ×3, `inversion`→`pre-mortem`, `probabilistic`→`bayesian`, `debiasing`→`pre-mortem`). The descriptions don't encode the distinctions, so the router picks "whichever fires first."

### C4. The router is the right shape but the wrong implementation (3/3)
All three: a static, hand-maintained markdown matrix will rot and doesn't scale.
- **Gemini:** "introduces a mandatory multi-turn latency tax (agent asks router → router responds → agent loads skill). Routing should be implicit, handled by vector search over [descriptions]."
- **GPT:** "lacks confidence scores, precedence rules, a strong NONE path, disambiguation questions, token-cost awareness, and generated metadata from the leaf skills."
- **DeepSeek:** "a static lookup table pretending to be a skill … no feedback loop; routing mistakes are never captured."

### C5. "Quality" today measures headers, not reasoning (3/3 + the data)
All three endorsed the core premise of this work: structural lint (90%) is silent on whether a skill helps. **Eval corroboration is the whole scorecard** — e.g. `triz` scores rubric 4.4 / structural 89% yet behavioral **0%**; `occams-razor` and `five-whys-plus` score rubric **4.8** yet behavioral 33%. Structural ≠ rubric ≠ behavioral; they measure different things, and a skill can be excellent on one and fail another.

## 2. The convergent contrarian insight (the most important non-obvious takeaway)

Each reviewer's "most contrarian idea" landed on the **same** thesis from a different angle — which makes it anything but a fringe view. For a frontier model, **the verbose skill files may be net-negative; the durable value is triggers + boundaries + LLM-specific failure modes, not mental-model tutorials the model already knows.**

- **Gemini (most extreme):** "teaching frontier models 'mental models' via 2000-word files is fundamentally backwards. The model already possesses these concepts in its weights … The most effective version wouldn't use markdown at all — it would be 39 highly-optimized, 2-sentence prompt injections."
- **GPT:** "the best product may not be 39 auto-invoked skills … the durable value is a smaller failure-mode checklist plus a router that mostly says *don't use a mental model; gather evidence, run the test, inspect the code, make the smallest safe change.*"
- **DeepSeek:** "ship the skills the model already knows as lightweight **triggers**, not textbooks; reserve full guides for skills whose procedural content adds capability beyond pretraining."

**Eval corroboration (length-controlled Tier 3):** when the treatment is compared to a **same-length neutral placebo** (not an empty baseline), mean win-rate is **56%** and **12/36 skills regress** (the placebo matches or beats the full skill), several flagged "vocab-only" (framework theater). The naive "skill vs nothing" pilot had rated `second-order` at 67%; length-controlled it drops to 33%. This is direct evidence that a meaningful chunk of the measured "value" is context-length, not mental-model content.

**Trigger-vs-instruction probe (DeepSeek's proposed test, 8 skills, `tier3-trigger-probe.json`) — confirms the thesis, with a clean bifurcation.** Mean **skill-vs-trigger = 50%**: on average **the full 2,000–4,000-word SKILL.md is no better than a 2-sentence trigger** for a frontier solver. But the split is exactly what DeepSeek predicted:
- **Full guide earns its length** (procedure adds capability): `bayesian` (100% vs trigger), `debiasing`/`pre-mortem`/`opportunity-cost` (67%) — a calculation, a checklist, a structured process (pre-edit, directional, not replicated — small-n trigger probe, superseded by M5 powered evidence).
- **Trigger suffices / guide is dead weight** (concept already in weights): `first-principles`, `theory-of-constraints` (trigger ties or beats the full guide).

This operationalizes R5: **ship known concepts as triggers; reserve full SKILL.md files for procedural skills that demonstrably beat the one-liner.**

**Capability-curve probe (weaker `haiku` solver, 6 skills, `tier3-haiku.json`) — weak, mixed support.** Aggregate 61% (vs sonnet on the same skills); `occams-razor` strongly fits the hypothesis (haiku 100% vs sonnet 33%) and `debiasing` leans that way, but `first-principles` contradicts it (haiku 33% vs sonnet 100%). At n=3 this is suggestive, not conclusive: skills help weaker models *somewhat* more, but not monotonically. It does rule out "the skills are universally inert" — several produce real lift on the weaker model [SUPERSEDED — pre-M5 finding at n=3, not replicated; canonical scorecard shows no skill achieved replicated ELEVATE].

---

## 3. Disagreements (useful signal about contested choices)

- **Does the eval already catch a bad skill?** DeepSeek: **yes** (with the placebo fix). GPT and Gemini: **no, as originally specified** — the length confound and "model already knows it" mean the naive design over-credits skills. *Resolution:* they were right about the naive design; the placebo control + probes (added mid-run in response) address it.
- **How radical should the fix be?** Gemini wants to abolish markdown skills entirely (→ 2-sentence injections). GPT wants a much smaller failure-mode checklist + a "don't use a model" router. DeepSeek is the most conservative: keep the collection, add boundaries, consolidate clusters, ship known skills as triggers. The disagreement is *degree*, not direction.
- **Which skills are weakest** differed by reviewer (each surfaced different examples), which is why the consensus lives at the **theme** level (C1/C2), not a single ranked kill-list. The one skill flagged weak by ≥2 holistic reviewers *and* bottom-of-rubric *and* behaviorally regressing is **`debiasing`** (rubric 3.0, behavioral 0%); **`dual-process`** is the sharpest contradiction (see §5).

---

## 4. Most valuable UNIQUE ideas (single-model, worth considering)

**From DeepSeek-V4 (the most methodologically incisive reviewer):**
- **Trigger-vs-instruction test** (now implemented) — the single best eval-design contribution; it operationalizes "textbook vs one-liner."
- **A companion set of LLM-failure-mode skills** — sycophancy toward user framing, recency/context-window bias, inability to hold multiple calibrated hypotheses, over-reliance on authoritative-sounding text, failure to express calibrated uncertainty. *"The collection addresses how humans fail; it doesn't address how LLMs fail — and those are different failure modes."* High-value gap.
- **Five missing decision models:** cost-of-delay/decision-velocity, stakeholder/organizational-power analysis, information-foraging/when-to-stop-researching, assumption-articulation (surface implicit premises), escalation/when-to-defer.

**From Gemini-3.1:**
- **Implicit vector-search routing** over skill descriptions instead of a multi-turn router (removes the latency tax).
- **The "template-hallucination" mechanism** — rigid N-point templates *induce* fabricated evidence to fill slots. A concrete, testable failure mode that argues for softer scaffolding.
- **Missing engineering-native models:** divide-and-conquer/bisection (git-bisect logic), technical-debt tradeoff, CAP-theorem-style tradeoff analysis.

**From GPT-5.5 (the broadest gap analysis):**
- **An "evidence ladder for agents"** — when to inspect files vs run tests vs search docs vs ask the user vs stop. Arguably the most agent-relevant missing skill of all.
- **Chesterton's Fence as a first-class guardrail** *before* `via-negativa`/simplification/refactoring — directly mitigates a deletion hazard.
- **Goodhart's/Campbell's Law** for metric-gaming, OKRs, and **agent reward-hacking**.
- Plus a deep bench: reference-class forecasting (outside view), expected-value/value-of-information (beyond Bayesian updating), causal inference, threat-modeling (STRIDE/attack-trees) to replace generic red-team for security work, Normal Accident Theory, principal-agent/incentive design.

## 5. The orthogonality the data exposes (cross-tier nuance)

Behavioral performance and mislead-risk are **independent axes** — the single most important nuance for acting on this:
- **`first-principles`**: behavioral **100%** (helps on these problems) yet **3/3 "would-mislead"** (could reinvent custom auth elsewhere). *Keep, but add a strict "don't reinvent standard/secure solutions" boundary.*
- **`dual-process`**: behavioral **100%** yet DeepSeek calls it the weakest skill ("System 1/2 doesn't map to LLM cognition — anthropomorphizing noise"). *Strongest evidence that a high behavioral score on 3 gotcha-problems ≠ sound for agents.* Needs a from-scratch agent reframe.
- **`debiasing` / `regret-minimization` / `triz`**: behavioral **0%** AND flagged weak. *Highest-priority rewrites or trigger-only demotions.*
- **`circle-of-competence`**: rubric **2.4** (lowest) yet behavioral **67%**. *Don't cut on content score alone.*

A single-number quality gate would have made the wrong call on every one of these.

## 6. Prioritized recommendations (recommend-only)

| # | Recommendation | Evidence | Impact | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | **Add an agent-specific "When NOT to use / Stop conditions" section to every skill**, and strip human-only stage directions ("gather the team", "project to age 80"). | C1, C2; Tier1 discrimination 3.38; 6 mislead flags; 23/24 per-skill mislead | High | Med |
| R2 | **Rewrite the 6 mislead-flagged skills for an agent consumer** (`regret-minimization`, `pre-mortem`, `circle-of-competence`, `bayesian`, `first-principles`, `socratic`) — remove human-cognition assumptions; add "don't fabricate numbers / don't roleplay / don't interrogate instead of acting." | C1; Tier1 flags | High | Med |
| R3 | **Consolidate the 5 overlap clusters**, starting with the 3 unanimous merges (bayesian+probabilistic; model-selection→router; inversion+pre-mortem). Keep one skill per job with clear internal variants. | C3; Tier2 strict 90% vs lenient 99% | High | High |
| R4 | **Replace structural lint with this 4-tier harness as the quality gate** (keep Tier 0 as a free pre-filter). Adopt the length-controlled Tier 3 + trigger probe. | C5; whole scorecard | High | Low (built) |
| R5 | **Demote "model-already-knows-it" skills to lightweight triggers** where the trigger probe shows trigger ≈ full guide; reserve full SKILL.md for skills whose procedure adds capability. | §2 convergent contrarian; length-controlled Tier 3 | High | Med |
| R6 | **Evolve the router** to confidence-scored / implicit selection with a strong NONE path, token-cost awareness, and metadata generated from leaf descriptions. | C4 | Med | High |
| R7 | **Sharpen all descriptions to be situation-named and ≤200 chars** (8 currently over-budget; many name the framework, not the trigger). | EVALUATION discoverability; Tier2 | Med | Low |
| R8 | **Add a companion set of LLM-failure-mode skills** (sycophancy, recency, calibration, authoritative-text over-reliance) and an **evidence-ladder-for-agents** skill. | DeepSeek + GPT unique | Med | High |
| R9 | **Fill the highest-value missing models:** Chesterton's Fence (guard before via-negativa), Goodhart's Law, reference-class forecasting, cost-of-delay. | GPT/DeepSeek/Gemini unique | Med | Med |

## 7. Eval-the-evals (what the adversaries changed about this work)

The review improved the methodology mid-run — the system working as intended:
- **Placebo-length control** (DeepSeek's #1 flaw; GPT & Gemini concurred): the headline Tier 3 now compares skill vs a **same-length neutral placebo**, isolating content from context length. Implemented before the full run.
- **Strict vs lenient routing** (DeepSeek): Tier 2 now reports unique-correct (90%) separately from accept-siblings (99%), surfacing the discrimination problem the lenient metric hid.
- **Trigger-vs-instruction probe** (DeepSeek's contrarian): added to test whether each SKILL.md earns its length.
- **Capability-curve probe** (haiku solver): added to separate "skill is useless" from "frontier solver already reasons this way."
- **Acknowledged-not-fixed (out of scope this run):** small per-skill sample size (treat per-skill as directional), the self-referential Tier-1 "mislead" judge (partially cross-validated against Tier 3 here), and the absence of a real-usage telemetry tier (Tier 4) — the highest-signal tier none of this captures.

## Artifacts
- Eval scorecard: `evals/results/run1/scorecard.md` (+ `tier{0,1,2,3}-*.json`, probes)
