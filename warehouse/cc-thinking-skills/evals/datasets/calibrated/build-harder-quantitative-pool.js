A) The PM is right — multiplicity correction only applies when testing the same hypothesis multiple times.
B) The data scientist is right — always apply Bonferroni correction regardless of context.
C) The answer depends on the decision structure.

      prompt: `A software team is building a payment processing system. The architecture choice is between:
- Option A: Synchronous processing with strong consistency guarantees, 99.9% availability, p99 latency 200ms. Simpler to implement, easier to debug. Cost: $50K/month infrastructure.
- Option B: Eventual consistency with asynchronous processing, 99.99% availability, p99 latency 50ms (perceived). More complex — requires reconciliation jobs, idempotency keys, and compensating transactions for failures. Cost: $80K/month infrastructure + estimated $200K additional engineering time to build correctly.

The business processes ~$50M/month in payments. Each minute of downtime costs roughly $35K in lost revenue. The "eventual consistency" bugs (double charges, missed payments) have happened in 15% of similar implementations at other companies, costing an average of $500K to fix + regulatory scrutiny.

Which architecture choice is most justified?

A) Option A — the lower engineering complexity and elimination of consistency risks outweigh the availability difference, given the high cost of eventual-consistency bugs.
B) Option B — higher availability always wins for payment systems.
C) Option A for MVP, then migrate to Option B after 6 months.
D) Use a hybrid: synchronous for critical paths, async for non-critical ones.
E) Neither — use a third-party payment processor and avoid building this entirely.`,
