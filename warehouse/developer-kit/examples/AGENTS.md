# AI Agent Workflow: Specification-Driven Development (SDD)

This document defines the mandatory workflow for AI coding agents interacting with this repository. To ensure high-quality, maintainable, and synchronized code, all agents **MUST** follow the Specification-Driven Development (SDD) process provided by the `developer-kit-specs` plugin.

## 1. Core Principles

- **Spec is Truth**: The functional specification in `docs/specs/` is the single source of truth for *WHAT* should be built.
- **SDD Triangle**: Always keep **Specification**, **Tests**, and **Code** aligned. Every change must update all three.
- **Atomic Tasks**: Implementation happens only through atomic tasks generated from a specification.
- **Living Deliverables**: Specifications are not static; they must be updated when implementation reveals new constraints or refinements.

## 2. The SDD Lifecycle

AI Agents must follow these three phases in order:

### Phase 1: Specification & Planning
Before writing any implementation code:
1. **Brainstorm**: Use `/specs:brainstorm "idea"` to create a functional specification in `docs/specs/[ID]/`.
2. **Quality Check**: Run `/specs:spec-quality-check docs/specs/[ID]/` to validate the requirements.
3. **Generate Tasks**: Convert the spec into executable tasks using `/specs:spec-to-tasks --lang=[lang] docs/specs/[ID]/`.
4. **Manage Scope**: If a task has complexity > 50, use `/specs:task-manage --action=split` to break it down.

### Phase 2: Implementation (Per-Task Loop)
For **each** task in `pending` status, follow this strict sequence:
1. **RED Phase (TDD)**: Run `/specs:task-tdd --task="..."` to generate failing tests first.
2. **GREEN Phase**: Run `/specs:task-implementation --task="..."` to implement the logic and make tests pass.
3. **Review**: Run `/specs:task-review --task="..."`. You **MUST** fix all findings until the review passes.
4. **Cleanup**: Run `/specs:code-cleanup --task="..."` to perform final code hygiene (no logic changes allowed here).

### Phase 3: Finalization & Sync
After completing one or more tasks:
1. **Spec Sync**: Run `/specs:specs.sync docs/specs/[ID]/`. This detects drift and updates the functional spec with decisions made during coding.
2. **Context Sync**: Run `/specs:spec-sync-context docs/specs/[ID]/` to update the Knowledge Graph and task metadata.

## 3. Automation with Ralph Loop

For long-running implementations or multiple tasks, use the **Ralph Loop** to manage context and state:
1. **Initialize**: `python3 plugins/developer-kit-specs/skills/ralph-loop/scripts/ralph_loop.py --action=start --spec=docs/specs/[ID]/`
2. **Iterate**: Run `python3 .../ralph_loop.py --action=loop --spec=...` to get the next command, execute it, and repeat.

## 4. Mandatory Commands Reference

| Command | When to use |
|---------|-------------|
| `/specs:brainstorm` | Starting a new feature. |
| `/specs:change-spec` | Bug fixes and modifications to existing features. |
| `/specs:task-tdd` | Mandatory first step of implementation (RED). |
| `/specs:task-implementation` | Implementing the solution (GREEN). |
| `/specs:task-review` | Mandatory gate before cleanup. |
| `/specs:specs.sync` | Closing the loop by updating the spec. |

## 5. Prohibited Actions

- **DO NOT** implement features without a corresponding task in `docs/specs/`.
- **DO NOT** skip the `task-review` step.
- **DO NOT** modify functional logic during the `code-cleanup` phase.
- **DO NOT** leave the specification in a "drifted" state; always sync after implementation.

## 6. Behavioral Guidelines for AI Agents

These guidelines are designed to reduce common LLM coding mistakes and bias towards caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

### 6.1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 6.2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.
- Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 6.3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 6.4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

These guidelines are working if: fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.
