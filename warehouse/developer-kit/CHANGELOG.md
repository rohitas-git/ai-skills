### Migration from v2.x to v3.0

This release contains breaking changes. Follow this guide to migrate from v2.x.

#### Command Mapping

| Old Command | New Command | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| `/specs:drift-guard` | `/specs:spec-sync` | New anti-drift approach with improved monitoring |
| `/specs:spec-quality-check` | `/specs:spec-check` | Renamed for consistency |
| `/specs:task-tdd` | `/specs:task-implementation` | TDD phase integrated into implementation |

#### Migration Steps

1. Update command usage: `/specs:spec-quality-check` → `/specs:spec-check`
2. Remove old hook configurations: `rm -rf .claude-plugin/hooks/drift-guard/`
3. Migrate task states: `tdd_red` → `in_progress`, `tdd_green` → `review`

4. Update docs: `docs/sdd-triangle.md` → `docs/sdd-workflow.md`
