# Getting Started — Specification-Driven Development

This guide walks you through the core concepts of SDD and gets you productive in minutes.

## What is SDD?

Specification-Driven Development (SDD) is a workflow where you define **WHAT** you want to build before writing any
code. The specification becomes a contract between your idea and the implementation, enforced through automated quality
gates.

```
Idea → Specification → Tasks → Implementation → Review → Sync → Done
       (brainstorm)  (spec-to-tasks)             (task-review)  (specs.sync)
```

**Why SDD?**

- **Eliminates ambiguity**: Every feature is defined functionally before coding starts
- **Traceability**: Every line of code traces back to a requirement
- **Quality gates**: Automated review ensures nothing is missed
- **Living docs**: Specifications evolve alongside the codebase

## Prerequisites

- **Claude Code** installed and configured
- **Python 3.11+** (for hook scripts and Ralph Loop automation)
- **developer-kit-core** plugin installed (provides general-purpose agents)
- A **git repository** with at least one commit

## Installation

```bash
# Install the plugin from marketplace
/plugin marketplace add giuseppe-trisciuoglio/developer-kit

# Or install from local directory
/plugin install /path/to/developer-kit/plugins/developer-kit-specs
```

Verify installation:

```
/help
# You should see /developer-kit-specs:specs.brainstorm, /developer-kit-specs:specs.spec-to-tasks, etc.
```

## Your First Specification

Let's build a real feature: **user authentication with JWT tokens** for a Spring Boot application.

### Step 0: Establish the Constitution (once per project)

Before writing any specification, define the architectural DNA of your project:

```
/developer-kit-specs:constitution create
```

Claude will ask about your technology stack, architectural rules, and security constraints, then generate
`docs/specs/architecture.md` and optionally `docs/specs/ontology.md`. These documents act as non-negotiable guardrails
for all AI-generated code throughout the project lifecycle.

You only run `create` once. After that, use `check` to validate specs and tasks against them.

### Step 1: Brainstorm the Idea

```
/developer-kit-specs:specs.brainstorm Add user authentication with JWT tokens for a Spring Boot REST API
```

Claude will guide you through a 9-phase process:

1. **Context Discovery** — Analyzes your project structure, existing code patterns, dependencies
2. **Complexity Assessment** — Checks if the idea should be split into multiple specifications
3. **Idea Refinement** — Asks up to 3 clarifying questions (e.g., "Should refresh tokens be supported?")
4. **Functional Approach Exploration** — Presents 2-3 approaches, focusing on WHAT not HOW
5. **Contextual Codebase Exploration** — Examines existing security config, user entities, etc.
6. **Specification Presentation** — Shows the functional specification section by section
7. **Specification Generation** — Creates the full spec document
8. **Quality Review** — Verifies completeness and consistency
9. **Summary** — Lists outputs and recommended next steps

**Output files created:**

```
docs/specs/001-user-auth/
├── 2026-04-10--user-auth.md        # Main functional specification
├── user-request.md                  # Your original request
├── brainstorming-notes.md           # Session context and decisions
└── decision-log.md                  # Decision audit trail
```

The specification is technology-agnostic. It describes behaviors, not implementation details.

### Step 1.5: (Optional) Document Technical Plan

After generating a specification with brainstorm, you may want to document the technical approach:

```
/developer-kit-specs:specs.technical-plan --spec=docs/specs/001-user-auth/
```

The technical plan captures:
- **Technology Stack**: Exact versions with rationale (no ranges)
- **Architecture Decisions**: Key decisions with alternatives considered (AD-001, AD-002, ...)
- **Implementation Phases**: Step-by-step build plan with milestones
- **Performance Requirements**: Measurable targets (response time, throughput)
- **Risk Assessment**: What could go wrong and how to detect it
- **Project Structure**: Directory organization and naming conventions

### Step 2: Convert to Tasks

```
/developer-kit-specs:specs.spec-to-tasks --lang=spring docs/specs/001-user-auth/
```

Claude analyzes your specification and generates executable tasks:

1. **Reads the specification** and extracts functional requirements
2. **Generates specification artifacts** (`data-model.md` and `contracts/*`) directly from the spec
3. **Explores your codebase** to understand existing patterns (Spring Security, User entities, etc.)
4. **Breaks requirements into tasks** — atomic, testable units with clear acceptance criteria
5. **Generates a traceability matrix** mapping requirements to tasks

**Output files created:**

```
docs/specs/001-user-auth/
├── 2026-04-10--user-auth--tasks.md    # Task index
├── data-model.md                       # Generated domain model
├── traceability-matrix.md             # Requirements → Tasks mapping
├── contracts/                         # Generated interface contracts
│   ├── auth-api.openapi.yaml
│   └── README.md
└── tasks/
    ├── TASK-001.md    # Create User entity and repository
    ├── TASK-002.md    # Implement JWT token service
    ├── TASK-003.md    # Create authentication endpoints
    ├── TASK-004.md    # Add Spring Security configuration
    ├── TASK-005.md    # Write e2e tests for auth flow
    └── TASK-006.md    # Code cleanup and finalization
```

Each task file contains:

- **Frontmatter**: ID, title, status, dependencies, provides/expects contracts
- **Description**: What to implement
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Checkboxes for verification
- **Definition of Done**: Quality checklist

### Step 3: Implement a Task

```
/developer-kit-specs:specs.task-implementation --lang=spring --task="docs/specs/001-user-auth/tasks/TASK-001.md"
```

Claude follows a structured process:

1. **Validates prerequisites** — Checks git state, task dependencies, contracts
2. **Implements the code** — Writes production code following your project conventions
3. **Runs verification** — Executes tests, validates acceptance criteria
4. **Updates task status** — Automatically marks `in_progress` → `implemented`

**Hooks fire automatically:**

- `task_lifecycle.py` updates the task frontmatter based on checkbox changes and git state.

### Step 4: Review the Implementation

```
/developer-kit-specs:specs.task-review --lang=spring docs/specs/001-user-auth/tasks/TASK-001.md
```

The review validates 4 dimensions:

| Dimension               | What It Checks                                       |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Implementation**      | Does the code match the task description?            |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | Are all criteria met?                                |
| **Spec Compliance**     | Does it align with the original specification?       |
| **Code Quality**        | Language-specific best practices, patterns, security |

**Output:** `TASK-001--review.md` with pass/fail status and detailed findings.

### Step 5: Sync Specification with Implementation

After implementing several tasks, sync the spec with reality:

```
/developer-kit-specs:specs.sync docs/specs/001-user-auth/
```

This detects deviations (scope expansions, refinements, reductions) and updates the specification to match what was
actually built, while also updating the Knowledge Graph.
