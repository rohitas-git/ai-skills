# Brainstorming

Provides guided brainstorming to transform ideas into pure functional specifications (WHAT, not HOW). Focus on business
logic, use cases, and acceptance criteria — no code, frameworks, or technical patterns.

## Overview

This command produces a **functional specification** — a document that describes WHAT the system should do, without HOW
it will be implemented.

The new workflow:

```
Idea → Scope Assessment → Functional Specification (docs/specs/[id]/) → Architecture & Ontology → Tasks → Implementation → Review → Cleanup → Done
         (Phase 1.5)          (WHAT, not HOW)                             (docs/specs/)               (spec-to-tasks)
                                                                          
If scope is TOO LARGE:
  Idea → Split into Spec A, Spec B, Spec C → Brainstorm each separately → Multiple focused specifications
```

**Output**: `docs/specs/[id]/YYYY-MM-DD--feature-name.md`

Preferred naming is `YYYY-MM-DD--feature-name.md`. If the spec folder already uses legacy `*-specs.md` files, keep the existing convention instead of mixing both formats.

Where `[id]` is a unique identifier in format `NNN-feature-name` (e.g., `001-hotel-search-aggregation`).

### What vs. How

| Aspect   | Functional Specification (WHAT)     | Technical Design (HOW)         |
|----------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Focus    | Business rules, user behaviors      | Frameworks, patterns, code     |
| Language | Natural language                    | Technical terminology          |
| Examples | "User can reset password via email" | "Use Spring Security with JWT" |
| Output   | `docs/specs/[id]/`                  | `docs/plans/` (deprecated)     |

Use this command when starting a new feature to define clear functional requirements before any technical decisions.

## Usage

```bash
/developer-kit-specs:specs.brainstorm [idea-description]
```

After generating the functional specification, continue with:

```bash
/developer-kit-specs:specs.spec-to-tasks docs/specs/[id]/
```

## Arguments

| Argument           | Required | Description                                      |
|--------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `idea-description` | No       | Description of the idea or feature to brainstorm |

## Current Context

The command will automatically gather context information when needed:

- Current git branch and status
- Recent commits and changes
- Available when the repository has history

### Argument Details

**idea-description**

- Purpose: Describes the initial idea, feature, or problem to solve
- Format: Free text describing the concept
- Default: If not provided, the command will ask for it interactively
- Examples: "Add user authentication", "Design caching strategy", "Create a specification for subscription billing"
- Non-examples: "Fix this bug", "Modify this existing behavior", "Refactor payment module" → use `specs.change-spec` instead

---

You are helping a developer transform an idea into a fully formed design. Follow a systematic approach: understand the
project
context, explore the idea through targeted questions, explore existing code, propose alternative approaches, present the
design
incrementally, generate professional documentation, review the document, and recommend the next development command.

## Core Principles

- **Ask only high-signal questions**: Use AskUserQuestion only when the answer materially changes scope, acceptance criteria, or constraints. If the request is already clear, proceed without adding extra checkpoints.
- **Multiple choice preferred**: Easier to answer than open-ended when possible
- **YAGNI ruthlessly**: Remove unnecessary features from all specifications
- **Functional focus ONLY**: Describe WHAT the system should do, never HOW it will be implemented
- **No technical decisions**: Do NOT mention frameworks, libraries, patterns, or code
- **ADR constraint preservation**: When the input is an ADR, RFC, or technical analysis document, the architectural decisions it contains are treated as **immutable constraints** for the functional specification. If the brainstorming process identifies a need to override an ADR decision, the override MUST be explicitly documented in `decision-log.md` with a DEC entry referencing the original ADR.
- **Incremental validation**: Present specification in sections, validate each
- **Professional documentation**: Use specialist agent for high-quality documents
- **Be flexible**: Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense
- **Use TodoWrite**: Track all progress throughout
- **No time estimates**: DO NOT provide or request time estimates
- **Scope awareness**: Validate idea scope early; if too large, guide user to split into multiple focused specifications
- **Documentation-only boundary**: This command MUST NOT implement, patch, refactor, or modify application/source code. It may only create or update specification artifacts under `docs/specs/` and related spec documentation files.
- **Route fixes and deltas away**: If the user asks to fix a bug, change existing behavior, refactor existing code, or "just make the modification", STOP and route them to `/developer-kit-specs:specs.change-spec` or an implementation/debugging command. Do not perform the change inside brainstorming.

## Spec Lifecycle: Deliberate Death

Every specification has a limited lifespan. The spec is a living document that serves its purpose during implementation, but once the feature is built and verified, the spec transitions to a historical record.

### The Spec Is Dead, Long Live the Spec

| Phase | Spec State | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Creation** | Living document | Guide implementation decisions |
| **Implementation** | Reference artifact | Answer "what should this do?" |
| **Verification** | Validation checklist | Ensure spec compliance |
| **Completion** | Historical record | Audit trail, knowledge preservation |
| **Post-project** | Archived reference | Future maintenance and onboarding |

**The spec dies when:**
1. Implementation is complete and verified against the spec
2. The feature has been in production without spec-related issues
3. The spec has been superseded by a new version

**The spec is NOT deleted:**
- It becomes `archived/` in the spec folder
- It remains as historical record
- Future changes reference it as "original spec" or "preceding spec"

### Why "Deliberate Death"?

- Prevents spec rot: specs that never die become stale and misleading
- Encourages accurate specs: knowing a spec will be archived sharpens focus
- Supports knowledge transfer: archived specs provide valuable context
- Enables improvement: each spec lifecycle informs better next specs

### Spec Death Protocol

1. **During spec-to-tasks**: Spec is alive, every decision traces back to it
2. **During implementation**: Spec guides, deviations are documented
3. **During task-review**: Spec is validated against, findings trace to spec
4. **During sync**: Spec is updated to reflect implemented behavior
5. **After completion**: Spec is archived, not deleted

**Archive command** (after feature completion):
```bash
mv docs/specs/[id]/YYYY-MM-DD--feature-name.md \
   docs/specs/[id]/archived/YYYY-MM-DD--feature-name.md
```

Add to `archived/README.md`:
```markdown
## [Date] - [Feature Name] - COMPLETED
- Implementation: complete
- Status: verified against spec
- Superseded by: [link or N/A]
```

---

## Requirement Syntax: EARS Standard

All functional requirements in the generated specification MUST use **EARS syntax** (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax).

### Syntax Forms

| Form | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Event-driven** | `WHEN <event> THEN the system SHALL <action>` | `WHEN the user clicks "Submit" THEN the system SHALL validate the form data` |
| **State-driven** | `WHEN <system state> THEN the system SHALL <action>` | `WHEN the session expires THEN the system SHALL clear user data` |
| **Generic** | `The system SHALL <action>` | `The system SHALL encrypt all stored passwords with bcrypt` |
| **Feature** | `IF <feature> THEN the system SHALL <action>` | `IF multi-factor auth is enabled THEN the system SHALL require second factor` |
| **Negative** | `IF <unwanted condition> THEN the system SHALL <response>` | `IF SQL input detected THEN the system SHALL reject with 400` |

### Mandatory Keywords

- **SHALL** — obligation (use for MUST requirements)
- **WILL** — intention (use for planned features)
- **MAY** — permission (use for optional behaviors)

### Forbidden Words (cause ambiguity)

- "robust", "intuitive", "fast", "scalable", "efficient", "user-friendly"
- Replace with measurable criteria

### Requirement ID Format

- Format: `REQ-XXX` (e.g., `REQ-001`, `REQ-002`)
- Numbering: Sequential per spec
- Placement: Before each requirement text

### Example Good vs Bad

```markdown
# BAD (vague)
"The system must be fast and secure."

# GOOD (EARS)
"The system SHALL encrypt all stored passwords with bcrypt and cost factor ≥12."

# BAD (missing trigger)
"The user receives a confirmation email."

# GOOD (EARS)
"WHEN a purchase is completed THEN the system SHALL send a confirmation email to the customer's registered address."
```

### Validation Checklist

Before Phase 5 generation, verify:
- [ ] Every requirement has REQ-ID prefix
- [ ] Every requirement uses SHALL/WILL/MAY
- [ ] Every requirement has a trigger (WHEN/IF) or is generic
- [ ] No forbidden words present
- [ ] Each requirement is testable (can verify pass/fail)

## Non-Goals Enforcement

Every specification MUST include an explicit **"Non-Goals"** section that lists what the feature does NOT do.

**Purpose**: Prevent AI agent from adding "helpful" features outside the intended scope.

**Rules**:
1. If the feature doesn't include social login → add "No social login providers"
2. If the feature doesn't support real-time → add "No real-time updates or WebSocket support"
3. If there's no admin panel → add "No administrative interface"
4. Always include at least 3 non-goals

**Format**:
```markdown
## Non-Goals

This feature does NOT include:

- **Feature X**: [Brief explanation why excluded]
- **Feature Y**: [Brief explanation why excluded]
- **Feature Z**: [Brief explanation why excluded]
```

**Trigger Pattern**: "The system will NOT do X" or "X is out of scope for this feature"

### Common Non-Goals Templates (use as starting point)

#### Web Application
- No social login (OAuth, Google, GitHub, etc.)
- No multi-language support (English only)
- No real-time updates (no WebSocket, SSE, or polling)
- No offline mode or PWA support
- No mobile app (web-only)

#### Backend/API
- No GraphQL (REST only)
- No async processing (synchronous only)
- No caching layer
- No message queue integration
- No third-party integrations

#### Database/Data
- No data export functionality
- No data import/migration tools
- No backup/restore utilities
- No data archiving

#### Security
- No two-factor authentication
- No role-based access control (RBAC)
- No API key management
- No audit logging

#### Operations
- No monitoring/observability setup
- No CI/CD pipeline setup
- No containerization
- No deployment automation

**Rule**: Start with project-specific exclusions, then add domain-specific ones.

---

## Negative Requirements

Every specification SHOULD include explicit **"Negative Requirements"** that describe behaviors the system must NOT exhibit. These are constraints that prevent common failures, security issues, or anti-patterns.

### Purpose

- **Prevent failures**: Define what the system MUST NOT do to avoid known failure modes
- **Block security issues**: Specify anti-patterns that must never appear (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
- **Document constraints**: Make implicit exclusions explicit for future maintainers
- **Guide implementation**: Help developers avoid dangerous patterns during implementation

### Negative Requirements vs Non-Goals

| Aspect | Non-Goals | Negative Requirements |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Focus** | Features NOT included in this spec | Behaviors the system MUST NOT exhibit |
| **Type** | Scope exclusions (what we don't build) | Anti-patterns/prevention (how we don't build it) |
| **Example** | "No social login" | "The system SHALL NOT store passwords in plain text" |
| **Validation** | Is feature X built? | Does behavior Y occur in implementation? |

### Common Categories

**Security Constraints** (OWASP Top 10 based):
- No SQL string concatenation (use parameterized queries)
- No eval() or dynamic code execution
- No hardcoded credentials or secrets
- No user-generated content without sanitization
- No insecure direct object references

**Data Integrity Constraints**:
- No lost updates (optimistic locking or versioning)
- No data loss on concurrent operations
- No state corruption on failure

**Performance Constraints**:
- No N+1 query patterns
- No blocking operations in request handlers
- No unbounded data structures

**Reliability Constraints**:
- No silent failures (errors must be logged)
- No single points of failure without mitigation
- No data inconsistency across services

### Template Format

```markdown
## Negative Requirements

The system SHALL NOT:

### Security
- [Constraint 1 with REQ-ID]
- [Constraint 2 with REQ-ID]

### Data Integrity
- [Constraint 3 with REQ-ID]

### Reliability
- [Constraint 4 with REQ-ID]
```

### EARS Syntax for Negative Requirements

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Negative** | `IF <unwanted condition> THEN the system SHALL NOT <action>` |
| **Prevention** | `The system SHALL NOT <unsafe behavior>` |

Example:
```markdown
## Negative Requirements

The system SHALL NOT:

### Security
- REQ-NR001: IF user input is used in SQL query THEN the system SHALL NOT concatenate directly; it SHALL use parameterized queries with placeholders
- REQ-NR002: The system SHALL NOT store passwords in plain text; it SHALL use bcrypt with cost factor ≥12

### Data Integrity
- REQ-NR003: The system SHALL NOT allow concurrent updates to overwrite each other without detection; it SHALL implement optimistic locking
```

### Generating Negative Requirements

During Phase 5, identify negative requirements by asking:
1. "What failures could occur if we don't specify this?"
2. "What security issues could happen with this feature?"
3. "What anti-patterns might developers use?"
4. "What race conditions or data corruption could happen?"

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] At least 3 Negative Requirements present
- [ ] Each has REQ-NR prefix and EARS syntax
- [ ] Categories are identified (Security, Data Integrity, Reliability)
- [ ] No contradictions with positive requirements
- [ ] Directly traceable to anti-patterns or known failure modes

## [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] Marker Rules

Every specification may include `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers to identify areas requiring user input. However, to prevent specification bloat and ensure actionable outcomes, markers are **strictly limited to 3 maximum**.

### Why Maximum 3?

- **Focus**: Each marker represents a significant scope decision. Too many markers indicate the spec is not ready.
- **Actionability**: Resolving markers requires user time. More than 3 creates friction.
- **Quality over quantity**: Better to have 3 well-defined markers than 10 vague ones.

### Marker Requirements

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Max 3 markers** | No specification shall have more than 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total |
| **Specific questions** | Each marker must contain a specific, answerable question |
| **Inline placement** | Markers appear inline within requirement text, not as a separate section |
| **Impact prioritization** | Markers are prioritized: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical |

### When to Use a Marker

Mark with `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]` ONLY when ALL of these are true:
1. The choice **significantly impacts feature scope** or user experience
2. **Multiple reasonable interpretations exist** with different implications
3. **No reasonable default exists** for the domain

### When NOT to Use a Marker (Make an Informed Guess Instead)

| Area | Reasonable Default | Do NOT Mark |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| Data retention | Industry-standard for domain | Guess and document |
| Performance targets | Standard web/mobile expectations | Guess and document |
| Error handling | User-friendly messages + fallbacks | Guess and document |
| Auth method | Session-based or OAuth2 for web | Guess and document |
| Integration patterns | REST/GraphQL for web, function calls for libs | Guess and document |
| UI/UX details | Standard responsive design, standard patterns | Guess and document |
| Input validation | Standard type/range/boundary checks | Guess and document |

### Marker Syntax

```markdown
The system must support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which payment providers should be supported at launch?] for processing transactions.
```

The marker is placed **INLINE** within the requirement text. It does not replace the requirement — the requirement still stands with a best-guess default.

### Marker Validation Checklist

Before Phase 5 generation, verify:
- [ ] Maximum 3 markers present in the specification
- [ ] Each marker has a specific question (not vague "needs clarification")
- [ ] Markers are inline within requirement text
- [ ] Markers are prioritized by impact (scope > security > UX > technical)
- [ ] No markers for areas with reasonable defaults

### Marker Enforcement Examples

```markdown
# GOOD: Specific question, high impact
The system SHALL process payments via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which payment providers should be supported at launch?] (Stripe, PayPal, or both?)

# BAD: Vague question
The system SHALL support payments via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what should we support?] (unspecified)

# BAD: Technical detail (has reasonable default)
The database should use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: PostgreSQL or MySQL?] for storage.
→ Default: PostgreSQL. Document assumption in Assumptions section.

# BAD: Has reasonable default (REST API)
The system must expose [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: REST or GraphQL?] endpoints.
→ Default: REST. Document assumption in Assumptions section.
```

### Marker Count Validation in Phase 5

After generating the specification:
1. Count all `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION:` occurrences
2. If count > 3: Flag the spec and identify the excess markers
3. For excess markers: Either convert to a best-guess assumption OR defer to a future spec-check session
4. Report final marker count in the completion summary

---

## Hard Boundary: No Implementation During Brainstorming

This command is a **specification authoring workflow only**.

### Allowed File Changes

The command may create or edit only specification artifacts, such as:

- `docs/specs/[id]/YYYY-MM-DD--feature-name.md`
- `docs/specs/[id]/user-request.md`
- `docs/specs/[id]/brainstorming-notes.md`
- `docs/specs/[id]/decision-log.md`
- `docs/specs/ontology.md`

### Forbidden Actions

The command MUST NOT:

- Edit source code, tests, configuration, migrations, build files, or runtime assets
- Apply bug fixes, refactors, patches, or behavior changes
- Run code-formatting or code-modifying commands
- Create commits or branches for implementation work
- Treat a user request for "fix", "modify", "change", "patch", "refactor", "correggi", "modifica", "risolvi", or "sistema" as permission to change code

### Required Response for Fix/Modification Requests

If the user request is primarily a bug fix or modification of existing behavior, respond with a routing message instead of implementing:

```markdown
This request is a bug fix or change to existing behavior, so `specs.brainstorm` is not the right workflow and I will not modify code from here.

Recommended next command:
/developer-kit-specs:specs.change-spec --type=bugfix "[short problem description]"

For an existing-behavior change that is not a defect:
/developer-kit-specs:specs.change-spec --type=delta "[short change description]"
```

After showing the routing message, always ask the user whether they want to create a **new functional specification** instead of a fix/change specification.

Use AskUserQuestion with these options:
- "Create a new functional spec with brainstorm" (continue only with documentation)
- "Use change-spec bugfix" (recommended for defects)
- "Use change-spec delta" (recommended for existing behavior changes)
- "Exit without changes"

Only continue with brainstorming if the user explicitly confirms they want a **new functional specification** and not a direct code change.

---

## Phase 0: Input Mode Detection & ADR Discovery

**Goal**: Determine whether the input is a free-form idea, an ADR/RFC, or a structured analysis document. If the input is a structured document, extract architectural decisions as constraints before proceeding.

**Context**: The `$ARGUMENTS` parameter may contain:
- A free-text idea (e.g., "Add user authentication with JWT tokens")
- A path to an existing document (e.g., `@docs/adr/039-git-worktree-management.md`)
- A reference to a file containing architectural decisions, RFC, or analysis

**Actions**:

1. **Detect input mode**:
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a file path pattern (starts with `/`, `./`, `docs/`, or `@docs/`): **Structured Document Mode**
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` is free text describing a feature: **Free-Form Idea Mode**
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty: Ask user for input and detect mode from their response

2. **If Structured Document Mode**:
   - Read the referenced document
   - Extract all **architectural decisions** documented in the file:
     - Configuration values, defaults, and file paths
     - CLI flags and command structures proposed
     - Integration patterns with existing systems
     - Error handling and edge-case strategies
     - Directory structures and documentation conventions
   - Create a `constraints` list in memory with the extracted decisions
   - **Do NOT re-evaluate these decisions** — they are the architectural foundation. The functional specification must work within them.
   - If a decision in the ADR contradicts project conventions (e.g., architecture.md, ontology.md), flag it as a conflict, not as a candidate for change

3. **If Free-Form Idea Mode**:
   - Proceed directly to Phase 1 — no constraints to extract
   - The brainstorming will discover all decisions collaboratively

4. **Decision override protocol**:
   - If during brainstorming you identify that an ADR decision should be overridden:
     - Create a DEC entry in `decision-log.md` with:
       - Reference to the original ADR (e.g., "Overrides ADR-039, Section 3: Configuration")
       - Justification for the override
       - Impact on the specification
     - Only then modify the constraint
   - Without a DEC entry, ADR constraints remain immutable

5. **Summarize constraints** (Structured Document Mode only):
   - After extraction, produce a brief summary:
   ```
   Input Mode: Structured Document (ADR-039)
   Constraints extracted:
   - Config: worktreeBasePath (default: ../<repo-name>-worktrees)
   - CLI: No explicit flags mentioned
   - Integration: ADR-038 branch creation
   - Behavior: Worktree creation + manual cleanup command
   Override DEC entries: None / DEC-XXX
   ```

---

## Phase 1: Context Discovery

**Goal**: Understand the current project state and the initial idea, within the bounds of any extracted constraints

**Initial idea**: $ARGUMENTS

**Actions**:

1. Create todo list with all phases (including Phase 0 if Structured Document Mode)
2. **Determine workflow tier before codebase exploration, document generation, or any action that could become implementation**:
    - **Bug fix** (defect in existing system):
        - STOP the brainstorming workflow by default
        - Do NOT inspect files with the intent to patch them
        - Do NOT edit source code, tests, configuration, migrations, or build files
        - Recommend `/developer-kit-specs:specs.change-spec --type=bugfix` for root cause analysis and regression prevention
        - Ask via AskUserQuestion only to confirm routing:
            - Options:
                - "Switch to change-spec bugfix" (recommended)
                - "Create a new functional spec with brainstorm" (only if the user wants a new specification instead of a bug fix workflow)
                - "Exit without changes"
    - **Modify existing behavior / refactor / delta change**:
        - STOP the brainstorming workflow by default
        - Do NOT apply the requested change
        - Recommend `/developer-kit-specs:specs.change-spec --type=delta`
        - Ask via AskUserQuestion only to confirm routing:
            - Options:
                - "Switch to change-spec delta" (recommended)
                - "Create a new functional spec with brainstorm" (only if the user wants a new specification instead of a delta/change workflow)
                - "Exit without changes"
    - **Direct implementation request** (e.g., "fix it", "make the change", "implement this now"):
        - Refuse to implement inside brainstorming
        - Explain that brainstorming only writes specs
        - Recommend the appropriate implementation/debugging workflow after a spec/task exists
    - **New feature** (any scope): Continue with brainstorm
3. Only after the request is confirmed as a new feature specification, explore the current project state (for context only - do NOT include in specification):
    - Read recent commits to understand what's being worked on
    - Check for existing documentation (README, docs/, existing specs)
    - Look for related features or similar implementations
4. If the idea is unclear, ask the user for:
    - What problem are they trying to solve?
    - What is the high-level goal?
    - Any initial thoughts or constraints?

---

## Phase 1.5: Complexity Assessment & Scope Validation

**Goal**: Assess idea complexity early and guide user to split if scope is too large for a single specification

**Actions**:

1. **Estimate implementation scope** based on the idea description and context from Phase 1:
   - Count distinct user stories / use cases mentioned
   - Identify separate functional domains or bounded contexts
   - Note integration points with external systems
   - Assess data model complexity (entities, relationships)
   - Evaluate user interaction complexity (flows, edge cases)

2. **Classify scope size** using these indicators:

   **Small Scope** (proceed normally - will generate 3-8 tasks):
   - Single user story or use case
   - One functional domain
   - 0-2 integration points
   - Simple data model (1-3 entities)
   - Straightforward user flow
   - Examples: "Add password reset", "Implement search filter", "Add user profile photo upload"

   **Medium Scope** (proceed normally - will generate 8-15 tasks):
   - 2-4 user stories
   - One focused functional domain
   - 2-4 integration points
   - Moderate data model (4-8 entities)
   - Multiple user flows but related
   - Examples: "User authentication with roles", "Product catalog with categories"

   **Large Scope** (WARNING - will likely generate >15 tasks - see step 3):
   - 5+ user stories
   - Multiple functional domains or bounded contexts
   - 5+ integration points
   - Complex data model (9+ entities)
   - Multiple independent user flows
   - Examples: "Full E-commerce system", "Multi-provider travel aggregator", "Complete CRM system"

3. **If scope is classified as LARGE**:
   - **Inform the user**: "This idea has a very large scope. To ensure high-quality implementation and maintainable code, I recommend splitting it into smaller, focused specifications."
   - **Propose a split strategy**: Suggest 2-3 smaller specifications that cover the original idea incrementally.
     - Example split:
       - Spec 1: Core domain and data model
       - Spec 2: Primary user flows and API
       - Spec 3: Advanced features and integrations
   - **Use AskUserQuestion** to offer options:
     - Options:
       - "Split the idea into the suggested specifications" (recommended)
       - "Focus only on one part of the idea" (ask which one)
       - "Continue with a single large specification" (not recommended - warn about task count limit)
   - If user chooses to split: Focus the current brainstorming session on the FIRST part of the split.
   - If user chooses to focus on one part: Focus the current session on that part.
   - If user chooses to continue: Proceed with a warning that `spec-to-tasks` will reject the spec if it exceeds 15 tasks.

---

## Phase 2: Idea Refinement

**Goal**: Clarify the requirements and constraints through a dialogue with the developer

**Actions**:

1. Ask up to 3 targeted questions to refine the idea:
    - Focus on ambiguities or missing information
    - Ask about edge cases or specific behaviors
    - Ask about integration with existing features
    - Ask about **exclusions and negative requirements** (what should the system NOT do?)
2. Incorporate any extracted constraints from Phase 0 into your questions
3. If the user provides a lot of information, summarize it to ensure alignment
4. If the user changes the idea significantly, restart the refinement phase

**Negative Requirements Question**:
During Phase 2, ask about exclusions that could become Negative Requirements:
- "Are there security constraints or anti-patterns we must avoid?"
- "Are there known failure modes or race conditions to prevent?"
- "Are there data integrity constraints beyond normal validation?"

---

## Phase 3: Functional Approach Exploration

**Goal**: Present 2-3 different functional approaches with trade-offs (WHAT, not HOW)

**Actions**:

1. Based on the refined idea, develop 2-3 distinct approaches focusing on BEHAVIOR:
    - **Approach A**: Simple/MVP (fastest to implement, may lack some features)
    - **Approach B**: Balanced (good feature set, reasonable complexity) - **typically your recommendation**
    - **Approach C**: Comprehensive (full-featured, more complex)

2. For each approach, describe ONLY functional aspects:
    - User behaviors supported
    - Business rules and constraints
    - Data requirements (what, not how)
    - Integration points (capabilities needed, not technical implementation)
    - Pros (benefits for users/business)
    - Cons (limitations, complexity for users)

3. **CRITICAL**: Do NOT mention any technical details:
    - NO frameworks (Spring, NestJS, React, etc.)
    - NO patterns (Repository, Service, Controller, etc.)
    - NO libraries or dependencies
    - NO code or pseudo-code

4. If there are materially different scope options, use AskUserQuestion to present them:
    - Lead with your recommended option
    - Explain your reasoning
5. If one approach is clearly dominant, select it, record the rationale, and proceed without an extra gate

6. **After approach selection, log the decision**:
    - Create an in-memory note of DEC-001: Approach Selection
    - Record: date, approach chosen, alternatives presented, rationale
    - This will be written to `decision-log.md` in Phase 6

---

## Phase 4: Contextual Codebase Exploration (Optional)

**Goal**: Understand existing codebase for context only — do NOT influence the specification with technical decisions

**NOTE**: This phase is OPTIONAL. Skip if not needed. The functional specification should be technology-agnostic.

**Actions**:

1. Only if the feature needs to integrate with existing systems, use the Task tool to explore:

```
Task(
  description: "Explore codebase for integration context",
  prompt: "Explore the codebase to understand what existing systems, APIs, or data structures the new feature must integrate with.

    Focus on:
    1. Existing APIs or interfaces the feature must use
    2. Shared data structures or models
    3. Existing business rules that apply

    Return:
    - List of integration requirements (capabilities needed, not implementation)
    - Do NOT suggest frameworks, patterns, or technical solutions",
  subagent_type: "developer-kit:general-code-explorer"
)
```

2. Incorporate findings as integration requirements in the specification
3. Do NOT let this influence technical decisions — keep the specification functional

---

## Phase 5: Functional Specification Presentation

**Goal**: Present the functional specification in validated sections

**DO NOT START WITHOUT APPROACH APPROVAL**

**Template**: Read the functional specification template using this lookup order to understand the target structure. The specification MUST follow this template:
- Primary (Claude plugin install): `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/functional-specification.md`
- Fallback (local copy shipped with this command): `commands/templates/functional-specification.md`
- If this command is installed as a standalone skill in another coding agent, read `templates/functional-specification.md` from that skill folder.

**Actions**:

1. Once the approach is selected, present the functional specification in sections of 200-300 words each
2. Incorporate any integration requirements from Phase 4
3. Cover the following areas in separate sections (matching the template structure):

   **Section 1: Business Context** (→ template: `## Business Context`)
    - What problem does this feature solve?
    - Who are the users and what are their goals?
    - How does this fit into the overall system purpose?

   **Section 2: Functional Requirements** (→ template: `## Functional Requirements`)
    - User stories and use cases
    - Business rules and constraints
    - Data requirements (what data, not how to store)
    - External system capabilities needed

   **Section 3: User Interactions** (→ template: `## User Interactions`)
    - User flows and journeys
    - Alternative paths and edge cases
    - Error scenarios and how users are informed

   **Section 4: Acceptance Criteria** (→ template: `## Acceptance Criteria`)
    - Clear, testable criteria for each user story
    - Success conditions in natural language
    - Edge case handling
    - **MANDATORY: Acceptance Criteria Taxonomy** — Every criterion MUST be classified with one of:
      - **`[IMP]` Implementable**: Requires new code, configuration, or explicit system behavior. **Only these generate implementation tasks.**
      - **`[SEF]` Side-Effect**: A natural, automatic consequence of an `[IMP]` criterion being satisfied. These do NOT generate standalone tasks but should be verifiable in e2e tests.
      - **`[EXT]` External Verification**: Verified by external tools, user observation, or existing system behavior. These do NOT generate tasks but should appear as e2e checkpoints.
    - **60% Rule**: At least 60% of acceptance criteria should be `[IMP]`. If fewer than 60% are `[IMP]`, the specification is too descriptive and not prescriptive enough — return to Section 2 and refine.
    - **Why this matters**: `spec-to-tasks` uses `[IMP]` criteria to generate atomic tasks. `[SEF]` and `[EXT]` criteria that are misclassified as `[IMP]` produce "false work" — tasks that verify natural behavior rather than implement functionality.

   **Section 5: Integration Requirements** (→ template: `## Integration Requirements`)
    - What existing systems must integrate with (capabilities, not implementation)
    - Data exchange requirements (not technical protocols)

4. **CRITICAL**: Throughout all sections, NEVER mention:
    - Frameworks, libraries, or tools
    - Technical patterns or architectural styles
    - Code or pseudo-code

5. Validate only at meaningful checkpoints:
    - Default: generate all sections, then present one consolidated review
    - Use AskUserQuestion mid-way only if a section introduces new ambiguity or a major scope decision

6. If no major ambiguity is detected, proceed directly to Phase 5.3 and collect feedback on the complete draft

---

## Phase 5.3: Non-Goals Definition

**Goal**: Explicitly define what this feature does NOT include

**Actions**:

1. **Review the idea description** and identify:
   - What was explicitly mentioned as out of scope
   - What was mentioned as in scope
   - Common related features that could be assumed

2. **Brainstorm potential Non-Goals** by asking:
   - "What would a developer naturally assume but is NOT in scope?"
   - "What related features could be 'helpful' but are excluded?"
   - "What technical capabilities are related but not required?"

3. **Generate Non-Goals list** (minimum 3):
   - Platform limitations (e.g., "No mobile app", "No offline mode")
   - Feature exclusions (e.g., "No social login", "No real-time sync")
   - Scope boundaries (e.g., "No multi-tenancy", "No plugin system")
   - Technical exclusions (e.g., "No WebSocket", "No GraphQL")

4. **Format each Non-Goal**:
   - Bold the excluded feature name
   - One sentence explaining why it's excluded
   - Connects to business logic when possible

**Output**:
```markdown
## Non-Goals

This feature does NOT include:

- **Social Login**: Only email/password authentication is supported
- **Multi-language Support**: Interface is English only
- **Real-time Updates**: No WebSocket or SSE support
- **Admin Panel**: User management done via database directly
- **Export/Import**: No data migration utilities
```

**Validation**:
- [ ] Minimum 3 Non-Goals present
- [ ] Each Non-Goal has explanation
- [ ] No contradictions with functional requirements
- [ ] Non-Goals are mutually exclusive with requirements

---

## Phase 6: Specification Generation

**Goal**: Generate professional functional specification document

**Actions**:

1. Compile all validated specification sections

2. Generate unique spec ID:
    - Count existing folders in `docs/specs/` to determine next sequence number
    - Create slug from feature name (lowercase, hyphenated)
    - Format: `NNN-feature-slug` (e.g., `001-hotel-search-aggregation`)
    - Example: If 5 specs exist, next ID is `006-feature-name`

3. Create spec folder: `docs/specs/[id]/`

4. **CRITICAL: Save the original user request**:
    - Create a file `user-request.md` in `docs/specs/[id]/` containing:
        - The original user input/idea description
        - Any constraints or requirements mentioned
        - This file will be used by `spec-to-tasks` to verify all requirements are captured
    - Example content:
      ```markdown
      # User Request

      **Original Input**: [what the user asked for]

      **Key Requirements Mentioned**:
      - [requirement 1]
      - [requirement 2]

      **Constraints**: [any constraints mentioned]
      ```

5. Use the Task tool to launch the document-generator-expert subagent:

```
Task(
  description: "Generate functional specification",
  prompt: "Generate a professional functional specification document based on the following validated specification:

    **Feature Title**: [title]
    **Date**: [current date]
    **Spec ID**: [id] (e.g., 001-hotel-search-aggregation)

    **Business Context**:
    - Problem solved: [from Section 1]
    - Target users: [from Section 1]
    - System fit: [from Section 1]

    **Functional Requirements**:
    - User stories: [from Section 2]
    - Business rules: [from Section 2]
    - Data requirements: [from Section 2]
    - External capabilities: [from Section 2]

    **User Interactions**:
    - User flows: [from Section 3]
    - Alternative paths: [from Section 3]
    - Error scenarios: [from Section 3]

    **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - Testable criteria: [from Section 4 — each MUST be tagged with [IMP], [SEF], or [EXT]]
    - Success conditions: [from Section 4]
    - Edge cases: [from Section 4]
    - **60% Rule Check**: Ensure at least 60% of criteria are [IMP]; if not, flag for refinement

    **Integration Requirements**:
    - Systems to integrate: [from Section 5]
    - Data exchange: [from Section 5]

    **Non-Goals**: [from Phase 5.3]
    **Negative Requirements**: [security, data integrity, reliability constraints]
    **Open Questions**: [list]

    Read the functional specification template using this lookup order and use it as the document structure:
    1. ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/functional-specification.md
    2. commands/templates/functional-specification.md
    3. templates/functional-specification.md inside the installed skill folder for non-Claude agents.
    Fill in the gathered information into the template sections.
    Save the result to: docs/specs/[id]/YYYY-MM-DD--feature-name.md

    IMPORTANT:
    - Read and follow the template using the lookup order above (primary: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/functional-specification.md`; fallback: `commands/templates/functional-specification.md`; standalone-skill fallback: `templates/functional-specification.md`)
    - This is a FUNCTIONAL specification, NOT a technical design
    - Do NOT mention any frameworks, libraries, or tools
    - Do NOT include code or pseudo-code
    - Focus on WHAT the system should do, not HOW
    - Use EARS syntax (SHALL/WILL/MAY) for all requirements
    - Include REQ-XXX prefix for each requirement
    - Every acceptance criterion MUST include its taxonomy tag: [IMP], [SEF], or [EXT]
    - Include Non-Goals section (minimum 3 items)
    - Include Negative Requirements section (minimum 3 items with REQ-NR prefix)",
  subagent_type: "developer-kit:document-generator-expert"
)
```

6. Wait for the document generator to complete
7. Verify the document was created successfully in `docs/specs/[id]/`
    - If the file was not created or is incomplete:
        - Check the subagent output for errors
        - Re-run Phase 6 with additional guidance if needed
        - Use AskUserQuestion to decide: "Retry generation", "Continue with manual creation", or "Abort"

8. **CRITICAL: Save brainstorming context files for later use by spec-to-tasks**:
    - If you have conversation context or notes about the feature (from the dialogue with user), save them to the spec
      folder
    - Create a file named `brainstorming-notes.md` in `docs/specs/[id]/` with:
        - Key technical decisions discussed
        - Architecture patterns mentioned
        - Any specific technologies or integrations requested
        - Notes about implementation approach
    - This file will be read by `devkit.spec-to-tasks` to ensure technical details are NOT lost

8.5. **Create decision-log.md for decision audit trail**:

- Create a file `decision-log.md` in `docs/specs/[id]/` with the following format:
  ```markdown
  # Decision Log: [Feature Name]

  | ID | Date | Task | Decision | Alternatives | Impact | Decided By |
  |----|------|------|----------|--------------|--------|------------|

  ## DEC-001: Approach Selection
  - **Date**: [current date YYYY-MM-DD]
  - **Task**: Brainstorming
  - **Phase**: Approach Selection
  - **Context**: Selection of functional approach for feature specification
  - **Decision**: [Approach chosen - A/B/C]
  - **Alternatives Considered**: [Brief description of approaches presented]
  - **Impact**: Specification structure, scope boundaries, acceptance criteria
  - **Decided By**: user selection
  ```
- This file will track all non-trivial decisions made during implementation
- Future phases (task-implementation, task-review) will append entries to this file

8.6. **Initialize or enrich the project ontology (`docs/specs/ontology.md`)**:

   Domain terms identified during brainstorming are part of the functional understanding (Ubiquitous Language). This step captures them in a shared, project-level ontology file.

   - **Check if `docs/specs/ontology.md` exists**:

   - **If the file does NOT exist**:
     1. Collect domain terms that emerged during the brainstorming dialogue (from Phases 2-5)
     2. Use **AskUserQuestion** to present the identified terms and ask the user to confirm, add, or remove terms:
        ```
        During brainstorming, the following domain terms emerged:
        - [Term 1]: [proposed definition]
        - [Term 2]: [proposed definition]
        - ...

        Should I create the project ontology (docs/specs/ontology.md) with these terms?
        ```
        - Options:
          - "Yes, create with these terms" (recommended)
          - "Yes, but let me adjust the terms first"
          - "Skip ontology creation for now"
     3. If the user confirms, create `docs/specs/ontology.md` using this template:
        ```markdown
        # Project Ontology — Ubiquitous Language

        **Created**: [current date YYYY-MM-DD]
        **Last Updated**: [current date YYYY-MM-DD]

        ## Domain Glossary

        | Term | Definition | Bounded Context |
        |------|-----------|-----------------|
        | [Term 1] | [Definition] | [Context where this term applies] |
        | [Term 2] | [Definition] | [Context where this term applies] |

        ## Bounded Contexts

        | Context | Description | Key Terms |
        |---------|-------------|-----------|
        | [Context 1] | [Description] | [Terms specific to this context] |

        ## Conceptual Mapping

        [Relationships between key domain entities — to be refined during task generation]
        ```

   - **If the file ALREADY exists**:
     1. Read the existing `docs/specs/ontology.md`
     2. Compare domain terms from the brainstorming session against existing glossary entries
     3. If NEW terms were identified that are not in the glossary:
        - Use **AskUserQuestion** to present the new terms and ask if they should be added
        - If confirmed, append the new terms to the Domain Glossary table
        - Update the `Last Updated` date
     4. If no new terms: skip silently

   - **Note**: The ontology is a living document. It will be further refined by `/developer-kit-specs:specs.spec-to-tasks` when technical decisions are made.

9. Update todos

---

## Phase 6.5: EARS Validation

**Goal**: Ensure all requirements follow EARS syntax before finalizing the spec

**Actions**:

1. **Parse all requirements** in the generated spec:
   - Extract requirements with `REQ-XXX` pattern
   - Identify requirements that lack REQ-ID

2. **Validate each requirement**:
   - Has REQ-ID prefix?
   - Uses SHALL/WILL/MAY keyword?
   - Has trigger (WHEN/IF) or is generic (no trigger)?
   - Contains forbidden words?

3. **Fix violations**:
   - Add missing REQ-IDs
   - Restructure requirements missing triggers
   - Replace forbidden words with measurable alternatives

4. **Document non-requirements**:
   - Explanatory text (not requirements) should NOT have REQ-ID
   - Notes and rationale are exempt from EARS syntax

5. **Update requirement count**:
   - Report final REQ count in summary
   - Flag if >50% of requirements are generic (may indicate missing triggers)

**Output**: EARS-compliant requirements section with validation report

Example output snippet:

```markdown
## Functional Requirements

### Authentication (4 requirements)

**Context**: User login and session management

| ID | Requirement | Trigger Type |
|----|-------------|--------------|
| REQ-001 | The system SHALL validate credentials against the user database | Event (login attempt) |
| REQ-002 | The system SHALL lock account after 5 failed attempts | Event (failed attempt) |
| REQ-003 | WHEN session expires THEN the system SHALL clear user data | State transition |
| REQ-004 | The system SHALL encrypt all passwords with bcrypt cost ≥12 | Generic |
```

---

### [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] Markers

When writing the specification, mark unclear aspects that require user input. This creates a bidirectional link with `specs.spec-check` which resolves these markers.

**When to use a marker**:

Mark with `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]` ONLY when ALL of these are true:
1. The choice **significantly impacts feature scope** or user experience
2. **Multiple reasonable interpretations exist** with different implications
3. **No reasonable default exists** for the domain

**When NOT to use a marker** (make an informed guess instead):

| Area | Reasonable Default | Do NOT mark |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| Data retention | Industry-standard for domain | Guess and document |
| Performance targets | Standard web/mobile expectations | Guess and document |
| Error handling | User-friendly messages + fallbacks | Guess and document |
| Auth method | Session-based or OAuth2 for web | Guess and document |
| Integration patterns | REST/GraphQL for web, function calls for libs | Guess and document |
| UI/UX details | Standard responsive design, standard patterns | Guess and document |
| Input validation | Standard type/range/boundary checks | Guess and document |

**Marker syntax**:

```markdown
The system must support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which payment providers should be supported at launch?] for processing transactions.
```

The marker is placed INLINE within the requirement text. It does not replace the requirement — the requirement still stands with a best-guess default. The marker flags the uncertainty.

**Rules**:

- **Maximum 3 markers total** across the entire specification
- **Prioritize by impact**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details
- Each marker must contain a **specific question** (not a vague "needs clarification")
- The surrounding requirement text should still be meaningful with the default assumption
- Do NOT create a separate "Needs Clarification" section — markers are inline

**Examples of good markers**:

```markdown
# Good: specific, scope-impacting
The system must process refunds [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should refunds be automatic or require manual approval?] within 5 business days.

# Good: security-impacting
User data must be retained [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what is the data retention period required by GDPR/compliance?] according to regulatory requirements.

# Good: UX-impacting with multiple interpretations
Search results should be sorted [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: by relevance, recency, price, or user-selectable?] by default.
```

**Examples of bad markers** (should be guessed instead):

```markdown
# Bad: has reasonable default (REST API)
The system must expose [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: REST or GraphQL?] endpoints.
→ Default: REST. Document assumption in Assumptions section.

# Bad: too vague
The system must be [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: fast?] for all users.
→ Bad marker. Make it measurable: "The system must respond to user actions within 2 seconds."

# Bad: implementation detail (not scope-level)
The database should use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: PostgreSQL or MySQL?] for storage.
→ This is an implementation decision, not a spec-level ambiguity. Don't mark.
```

**After spec generation**:

If any markers were placed, include a note in the completion summary:
```
Specification created with 2 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers:
  1. "Which payment providers should be supported?"
  2. "Should guest checkout be allowed?"

Next: Run /developer-kit-specs:specs.spec-check to resolve.
```

---

## Phase 7: Specification Review

**Goal**: Review the generated functional specification for quality, completeness, and EARS compliance

**IMPORTANT**: The functional specification should be technology-agnostic (WHAT), but technical details discussed during
brainstorming are preserved separately in `brainstorming-notes.md` for use by `spec-to-tasks`.

**Actions**:

1. Use the Task tool to launch a code-reviewer subagent to review the specification:

```
Task(
  description: "Review functional specification quality",
  prompt: "Review the functional specification at docs/specs/[id]/YYYY-MM-DD--feature-name.md for:

    1. **Completeness**: All required sections are present (Business Context, Functional Requirements, User Interactions, Acceptance Criteria, Integration Requirements, Out of Scope, Open Questions)

    2. **Functional Focus**: Verify the specification is purely functional:
       - NO mention of frameworks, libraries, or tools
       - NO technical patterns or architectural styles
       - NO code or pseudo-code
       - Focuses on WHAT, not HOW

    3. **Quality**: Content is clear, specific, and actionable

    4. **Testability**: Acceptance criteria are clear and testable

    5. **Acceptance Criteria Taxonomy**: Verify that:
       - Every acceptance criterion is tagged with `[IMP]`, `[SEF]`, or `[EXT]`
       - No `[SEF]` or `[EXT]` is disguised as `[IMP]` (e.g., "git worktree list shows worktree" should be `[SEF]`, not `[IMP]`)
       - At least 60% of criteria are `[IMP]`; if not, flag as "Under-specified — needs more prescriptive criteria"

    6. **Formatting**: Proper markdown structure, consistent formatting

    7. **Clarity**: Language is professional, concise, and unambiguous

    8. **EARS Compliance**: All requirements have REQ-ID, use SHALL/WILL/MAY, and have appropriate triggers

    9. **Negative Requirements**: At least 3 present with REQ-NR prefix and SHALL NOT syntax

    10. **Non-Goals**: At least 3 present with explanations

    Provide:
    - Overall assessment (Excellent / Good / Needs Revision)
    - List of any missing sections or content
    - Specific issues found (if any)
    - Any technical details that should be removed
    - EARS violations (if any)
    - Recommendations for improvement (if needed)",
  subagent_type: "developer-kit:general-code-reviewer"
)
```

2. Once the agent returns, synthesize the review findings

3. **Use the AskUserQuestion tool to present the review findings**:

   Present options based on agent assessment:
    - **Option A**: Document is excellent, proceed to next steps
    - **Option B**: Minor revisions needed (agent will specify what)
    - **Option C**: Major revisions needed (regenerate with corrections)

4. If revisions are needed:
    - For minor revisions: Edit the document directly based on agent feedback
    - For major revisions: Re-run Phase 6 with updated instructions from agent
    - Optionally: Re-run Phase 7 with another review if significant changes were made

5. Once approved, mark documentation phase complete

---

## Phase 8: Next Steps Recommendation

**Goal**: Recommend the appropriate next command in the workflow

**Actions**:

1. The functional specification is complete. The next step is to convert it to executable tasks:

   **For converting specification to tasks**: Recommend `/developer-kit-specs:specs.spec-to-tasks`
    - Use when: Converting functional specification to trackable tasks
    - Arguments: `--lang=[language] docs/specs/[id]/`

2. **Use the AskUserQuestion tool to present the recommendation**:

   Present options:
    - **Option A**: Run spec-check first, then generate tasks (recommended)
    - **Option B**: Skip review and go directly to task generation (warning: may have quality issues)
    - **Option C**: Exit and review the specification manually

3. Include the pre-filled commands:

```bash
# Recommended: Run spec-check first, then generate tasks
/developer-kit-specs:specs.spec-check docs/specs/[id]/
/developer-kit-specs:specs.spec-to-tasks --lang=[java|spring|typescript|nestjs|react|python|general] docs/specs/[id]/

# Alternative: Skip review and generate tasks directly
/developer-kit-specs:specs.spec-to-tasks --lang=[java|spring|typescript|nestjs|react|python|general] docs/specs/[id]/
```

   - The functional specification has been saved at `docs/specs/[id]/YYYY-MM-DD--feature-name.md`
   - The task list will be saved at `docs/specs/[id]/YYYY-MM-DD--feature-name--tasks.md`
   - Individual tasks will be in `docs/specs/[id]/tasks/TASK-XXX.md`

---

## Phase 9: Summary

**Goal**: Document what was accomplished

**Actions**:

1. Mark all todos complete
2. Summarize:
    - **Original Idea**: What was brainstormed
    - **Input Mode**: Free-Form Idea / Structured Document (ADR reference if applicable)
    - **Scope Assessment**: Small / Medium / Large (and user choice if large)
    - **Scope Split Decision**: [If applicable: "User chose to split into N specifications - focusing on Spec A: [name]" OR "User chose to continue with single specification despite large scope warning"]
    - **Approach Selected**: Which approach was chosen and why
    - **Integration Context**: Key integration requirements (if any)
    - **Functional Specification Created**: Key aspects of the specification
    - **Spec ID**: `[id]` (e.g., `001-hotel-search-aggregation`)
    - **Document Location**: `docs/specs/[id]/YYYY-MM-DD--feature-name.md`
    - **EARS Validation**: Number of requirements validated, any violations fixed
    - **Specification Review**: Review outcome and any revisions made
    - **[NEEDS CLARIFICATION] Markers**: Count and list of markers (if any)
    - **Recommended Next Step**: 
      - If scope was split: "Complete this specification's implementation, then run /developer-kit-specs:specs.brainstorm for Spec B: [name]"
      - Otherwise: "Generate task list with /developer-kit-specs:specs.spec-to-tasks"

---

## Integration with Development Commands

This brainstorming command produces a **functional specification** that feeds into the modular workflow:

```

### Specification as Reference

The functional specification created by this command serves as:

1. **Reference during implementation**: The development commands can read the specification for context
2. **Communication tool**: Can be shared with team members for review
3. **Documentation**: Becomes part of project's functional specification history
4. **Task generation input**: Used by `spec-to-tasks` to create executable tasks
5. **Organized storage**: All related files (spec, tasks, individual tasks) are grouped in `docs/specs/[id]/`

### Re-entering Brainstorming

If implementation reveals specification issues, you can re-run `/developer-kit-specs:specs.brainstorm`:
- The previous specification will be preserved in its folder
- A new specification will be created with the current date
- You can reference the previous specification during the new brainstorming session

## Todo Management

Throughout the process, maintain a todo list like:

```
[ ] Phase 0: Input Mode Detection & ADR Discovery (if applicable)
[ ] Phase 1: Context Discovery
[ ] Phase 1.5: Complexity Assessment & Scope Validation (split if scope too large)
[ ] Phase 2: Idea Refinement
[ ] Phase 3: Functional Approach Exploration
[ ] Phase 4: Contextual Codebase Exploration (Optional)
[ ] Phase 5: Functional Specification Presentation
[ ] Section 1: Business Context
[ ] Section 2: Functional Requirements
[ ] Section 3: User Interactions
[ ] Section 4: Acceptance Criteria (with [IMP]/[SEF]/[EXT] taxonomy)
[ ] Section 5: Integration Requirements
[ ] Phase 5.3: Non-Goals Definition
[ ] Phase 6: Specification Generation
[ ] Phase 6.1: Ontology Initialization/Enrichment (docs/specs/ontology.md)
[ ] Phase 6.5: EARS Validation
[ ] Phase 7: Specification Review
[ ] Phase 8: Next Steps Recommendation
[ ] Phase 9: Summary
```

Update the status as you progress through each phase and section.

**CRITICAL**: Phase 1.5 MUST assess scope size before proceeding:
- If scope is too large (>15 estimated tasks), guide user to split into multiple specifications
- Present split options clearly (by domain or by priority)
- If user chooses to split: focus ONLY on first spec, recommend brainstorming for remaining specs
- If user chooses to continue anyway: log warning and note potential rejection by spec-to-tasks

---

**Note**: This command follows a collaborative, iterative approach with specialist agents to ensure designs are:
- Based on actual codebase exploration (not assumptions)
- Well-thought-out and validated incrementally
- Documented professionally with specialist assistance
- Reviewed for quality before proceeding
- Ready for implementation with clear next steps

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Feature Idea

```bash
/developer-kit-specs:specs.brainstorm Add user authentication with JWT tokens
```

### Example 2: Complex Feature

```bash
/developer-kit-specs:specs.brainstorm Implement real-time notifications using WebSockets
```

### Example 3: Existing Behavior Change (do NOT use brainstorm)

```bash
/developer-kit-specs:specs.change-spec --type=delta "Make the payment processing behavior easier to maintain"
```

### Example 4: Bug Fix (do NOT use brainstorm)

```bash
/developer-kit-specs:specs.change-spec --type=bugfix "Fix the race condition in order processing"
```

### Example 5: New Performance Feature

```bash
/developer-kit-specs:specs.brainstorm Design a caching capability to reduce API response times
```

### Example 6: Integration

```bash
/developer-kit-specs:specs.brainstorm Integrate Stripe payment processing for subscriptions
```

### Example 7: ADR-Based Specification

```bash
/developer-kit-specs:specs.brainstorm @docs/adr/039-git-worktree-management.md
```

### Example 8: Full Workflow (after brainstorming)

```bash
# Step 1: Brainstorm and generate functional specification
/developer-kit-specs:specs.brainstorm Design a microservices architecture for the reporting module

# Step 2: Convert specification to tasks
/developer-kit-specs:specs.spec-to-tasks --lang=spring docs/specs/001-reporting-module/

# Step 3: Implement specific tasks
/developer-kit-specs:specs.task-implementation --lang=spring --task="docs/specs/001-reporting-module/tasks/TASK-001.md"
/developer-kit-specs:specs.task-implementation --lang=spring --task="docs/specs/001-reporting-module/tasks/TASK-002.md"
```

This separates WHAT (functional specification) from HOW (implementation), following the "divide et impera" principle.
